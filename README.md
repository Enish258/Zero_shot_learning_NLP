# Zero_shot_learning_NLP
(Work in progress)
Using Zero Shot learning for Natural Language Inference using triplet loss and contrastive loss.
Given a text and a reason, predict if text satisfies the reason.
The train dataset has only positive label samples so had to use Zero shot learning on senetnce transformers.
